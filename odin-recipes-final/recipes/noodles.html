                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Cold noodles on a warm day are as comforting as warm noodles on a cold day. It’s the way they are
                    eaten –
                    holding
                    the bowl with one hand, chopsticks or fork in the other, head slightly lowered; it’s their
                    texture – slippery and substantial; it’s their receptiveness to all the other textures and flavours
                    going on in
                    the same bowl.</p>
                <p><b>Getting ahead:</b> All the components can be made in advance here – the noodles and radishes up to
                    2
                    days
                    ahead, the
                    dressing up to 3 days – kept separate, in the fridge, ready for the dish to be assembled in just a
                    minute.</p>
                <p><b>Ingredients note:</b> Wakame has an interestingly oceanic flavour, which works so well against the
                    avocado.
                    The
                    texture is also great: slippery, crunchy and chewy at once. It’s widely available but, as an
                    alternative, packs
                    of sea vegetable salad also work well.</p>

                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pickle the radishes up to 2 days (or at least 30 minutes) ahead of eating. Place them in a
                        medium
                        bowl
                        and
                        add ¾
                        teaspoon of salt. Using your hands, gently massage for a minute or two, then add the remaining
                        pickle
                        ingredients. Transfer to a small bowl or jar and keep in the fridge until ready to use.</li><br>
                    <li>Rehydrate the seaweed: this takes 30 minutes in cold water (which is the best option) or 10
                        minutes
                        in
                        hot
                        water. Once rehydrated, drain and roughly tear any very large pieces and set aside in the
                        fridge.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>Place all the ingredients for the lemon soy dressing in a large screw-top jar and shake to
                        combine.
                        Keep
                        in
                        the
                        fridge until ready to use.</li><br>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of water to the boil. Add the noodles, stir, then cook for 3 minutes. Add
                        enough
                        cold
                        water to
                        stop the boiling process and continue to cook for another 2 minutes. Drain in a sieve and rinse
                        under
                        cold
                        running water. Drain well again, then transfer to a large bowl and add the sesame oil, mixing it
                        through
                        with
                        your hands. Cover and keep in the fridge until cold.</li><br>
                    <li>When ready to serve, use your hands to loosen and separate the noodles and add all the dressing,
                        the
                        drained
                        radishes, wakame, avocado, spring onions and basil. Toss gently to mix through, then transfer to
                        a
                        rimmed
                        serving platter or shallow bowl. Scatter over the toasted sesame seeds and serve.</li>
